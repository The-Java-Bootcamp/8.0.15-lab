# Lab: 8.0.15

**Objective:**

- Understand the concept and importance of interfaces in Java development.
- Learn how to define and implement interfaces in Java.
- Explore practical applications of interfaces in real-world Java projects.
- Identify common pitfalls and best practices when working with interfaces.
- Gain hands-on experience with a complete Java example that demonstrates interfaces.

**Prerequisites:**

- Basic understanding of Java programming.
- Familiarity with creating classes and objects in Java.
- Understanding of inheritance in Java.
- Knowledge of abstract classes and methods.

**What You'll Achieve:**

- Develop a solid understanding of interfaces and their role in Java.
- Implement practical examples that can be applied in real-world scenarios.
- Enhance your skills in object-oriented design, polymorphism, and loose coupling.

**Assignment Details**

In this assignment, you will create a simple smart home system using interfaces. Follow these steps:

1. Create an interface called `Device`:
   - Declare methods: `turnOn()`, `turnOff()`, `getStatus()`.
2. Create an interface called `VoiceControlled`:
   - Declare a method: `voiceControl(String command)`.
3. Create a class `SmartLight` that implements both `Device` and `VoiceControlled`:
   - Add a private boolean field `isOn`.
   - Implement all methods from both interfaces.
   - `voiceControl` should accept commands like "on" or "off".
4. Create a class `SmartThermostat` that implements Device:
   - Add private fields for `temperature` and `isOn`.
   - Implement all methods from the `Device` interface.
   - Add a method `setTemperature(int temp)`.
5. Create a class `SmartSpeaker` that implements both `Device` and `VoiceControlled`:
   - Add private fields for `volume` and `isOn`.
   - Implement all methods from both interfaces.
   - `voiceControl` should accept commands like "volume up", "volume down", "on", or "off".
6. Create a `SmartHomeController` class with a `main` method:
- Create an array of `Device` objects containing instances of `SmartLight`, `SmartThermostat`, and `SmartSpeaker`.
- Implement a method `controlDevice(Device device)` that turns the device on or off and prints its status.
- Implement a method `voiceControl(VoiceControlled device, String command)` that sends voice commands to compatible devices.
- Demonstrate the use of these methods with different devices.

**Example Output**

```
Smart Home System:

Controlling devices:
Smart Light is ON
Smart Thermostat is ON
Smart Speaker is ON

Voice controlling compatible devices:
Smart Light responded to voice command: on
Smart Speaker responded to voice command: volume up

Smart Light status: ON
Smart Thermostat status: ON (Temperature: 22Â°C)
Smart Speaker status: ON (Volume: 6)
```

**Starter Code**

The `SmartHomeController.java` file contains the following starter code:

```java
package academy.javapro.lab;

interface Device {
    void turnOn();
    void turnOff();
    String getStatus();
}

interface VoiceControlled {
    void voiceControl(String command);
}

class SmartLight implements Device, VoiceControlled {
    // Implement this class
}

class SmartThermostat implements Device {
    // Implement this class
}

class SmartSpeaker implements Device, VoiceControlled {
    // Implement this class
}

public class SmartHomeController {
    public static void controlDevice(Device device) {
        // Implement this method
    }

    public static void voiceControl(VoiceControlled device, String command) {
        // Implement this method
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create devices and demonstrate the smart home system
    }
}

```

**Hints**

- Remember that interfaces in Java can only declare abstract methods (prior to Java 8) and constants.
- A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing for a form of multiple inheritance of behavior.
- Use the `instanceof` operator to check if a Device is also `VoiceControlled` before attempting to use voice commands.
- Consider using enums for device states or command types to make your code more robust.
- Think about how interfaces promote loose coupling in your smart home system design.
